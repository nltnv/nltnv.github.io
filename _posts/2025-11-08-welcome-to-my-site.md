Welcome to my new website! This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how the blog post template works.

## Writing in Markdown

You can write your posts in markdown, which makes it easy to format your content. Here are some examples:

### Text Formatting

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. You can also create `inline code` snippets.

### Lists

Unordered lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Ordered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Links and Images

You can add [links to other pages](https://example.com) easily.

You can also embed images:

![Sample image description](/assets/images/sample-post-image.jpg)

### Quotes

> This is a blockquote. You can use it to highlight important passages or quotes from other sources.

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    return True
```

## Embedding Content

This template supports all standard markdown features, so you can:

- Embed images throughout your posts
- Add code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Create tables
- Add horizontal rules

That's it for this sample post. Delete this and create your own posts in the `_posts` directory with the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
